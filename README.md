# REPL Calculator with Advanced Testing in Python
## Project Overview:

Welcome to the Module 3 assignment, where we create a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for basic arithmetic operations.
Which allows users to perform calculations interactively by entering numbers and selecting operations.
This project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and advanced testing techniques.

## Object-Oriented Programming and Advanced Testing

For this project, we used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a class called Operation.
This class contained methods for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Instead of creating a separate function for each operation, we defined static methods within the Operation class.
Static methods allow us to call these methods without needing to create an instance of the class. This allows us to group related operations together and makes the code more organized and reusable.

We use parametrization with pytest to test various scenarios for each operation. This allowed us to efficiently test multiple scenarios with different inputs, and ensure that the methods behave as expected. Parametrization tests help in validating the correctness of the methods by checking against expected results for a variety of inputs, including edge cases.

## Features
- Interactive REPL Calculator: User can perform basic calculations interactively by entering numbers and selecting operations in a loop.
- Object_Oriented Design: Arithmetic operations are implemented as static methods within the Operation class to promote code reusability and organization.
- Error Handling: Handling invalid inputs and division by zero by providing user-friendly messages. 
- User-Friendly Interface: Clear prompts and instruction to guide user through the calculation process
- Advance Testing: Uses parametrization with pytest to test various scenarios for each operation


## Setup
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): developed by Microsoft to enable users to run a Linux enviroment directly on Windows machine. 
- Git: open-source distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes in the source code. 
- VSCode (Visual Studio Code): use to set up python virtual enviroment, and isolating project dependencies
- Python: main programming language for the calculator and tests
- pytest: for advanced testing of the code
- Homebrew(for mac users): for installing packages on macOS

## Setup Instruction

# üß© 1. Install Homebrew (Mac Only)

> Skip this step if you're on Windows.

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS.  
You‚Äôll use it to easily install Git, Python, Docker, etc.

**Install Homebrew:**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Verify Homebrew:**

```bash
brew --version
```

If you see a version number, you're good to go.

---

## WSL:
On powershell and type the following command to see a list of valid distributions that can be installed.

```bash
wsl --list --online
```
From the list install Ubuntu using the following command:

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```
After it's installed, create a new UNIX username and set password (make sure you remember the password, as there is no way to get it back)

# üß© 2. Install and Configure Git

## Install Git

- **MacOS (using Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install git
```

- **Windows**

Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
Accept the default options during installation.

**Verify Git:**

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Configure Git Globals

Set your name and email so Git tracks your commits properly:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Confirm the settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## Generate SSH Keys and Connect to GitHub

> Only do this once per machine.

1. Generate a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

(Press Enter at all prompts.)

2. Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add the SSH private key to the agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy your SSH public key:

- **Mac/Linux:**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
```

- **Windows (Git Bash):**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

5. Add the key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
   - Click **New SSH Key**, paste the key, save.

6. Test the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a success message.

# üß© 3. Clone the Repository

Now you can safely clone the course project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

---

# üõ†Ô∏è 4. Install Python 3.10+

## Install Python

- **MacOS (Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install python
```

- **Windows**

Download and install [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
‚úÖ Make sure you **check the box** `Add Python to PATH` during setup.

**Verify Python:**

```bash
python3 --version
```
or
```bash
python --version
```

---

## Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

(Optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
```

### Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# üê≥ 5. (Optional) Docker Setup

> Skip if Docker isn't used in this module.

## Install Docker

- [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

# üöÄ 6. Running the Project

- **Without Docker**:

```bash
python main.py
```

(or update this if the main script is different.)

- **With Docker**:

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

# üìù 7. Submission Instructions

After finishing your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Module X"
git push origin main
```

Then submit the GitHub repository link as instructed.
